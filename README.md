# Animated Linear Gradient

A Flutter project that displays a fullscreen linear gradient. The gradient endlessly cycles through colors.
The GPS location (latitude, longitude) of the device is displayed in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
The button in the middle serves as the initiator of the animation when it is pressed.
